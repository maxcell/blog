After [Mackenzie Child](https://mackenziechild.me/) did his own version of [this](https://mackenziechild.me/2017/) (and [Levi](http://levibostian.com/blog/) has his [too](http://levibostian.com/blog/2017/)), I found it meaningful for myself to have a tangible list of accomplishments I have made for the year. This is a means for me to be reminded on how I changed from January 1st, 2017 to December 31st, 2017.
