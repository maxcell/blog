A lot of people would call me a "positive person". I would respond with, "I try to be positive because positive things happen to positive people." Even though it is corny and is explained by the [Law of Attraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_attraction_(New_Thought)), I really do believe that. I still look to being positive on my outlook **since things do not get better when we only look at our negatives.**

A lot of things can happen in our lives but that does not mean we should just stay fixated on some thing that goes wrong. When we do that, we don't grow. We actually suffer from this. We want to only see what we could have done better and that's not what we should be looking at. We are all going to make mistakes and that's okay. I know for myself, I used to get anxious and hesitant when I felt like I was going to approach a point of failure. However, through my internship experience, I learned that in order to grow, you need to own your feelings and just move forward with them. **You feel better. You don't stay stuck with who you were. You get to fail faster and you get to success faster.** These are all things we want to do (maybe less failing and more success but _details_...).

This really was a repetitive conversation that I was having with several people as I was trying to understand how to improve myself. I was trying to understand how we were not just covering up or hiding our true feelings. When you explain your situation to yourself in a more objective way, you get to really understand what is in and out of your control. I believe in an internal locus of control. Everything that happens in my life is through my actions and so sometimes, it is hard to accept things for being out of your control. But like I said, this experience showed me how sometimes things happen for a good reason and you really get to see how much you really grew because your experience.

Not only that, but there were a few other things that did happen through this experience. Which could be a consequence of it or just purely coincidence, but check out my other blog post which kind of outlines my last few weeks of summer!
