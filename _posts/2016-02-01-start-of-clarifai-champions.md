Clarifai Champions is a program hosted by the awesome NY Startup, Clarifai, in order
to support the next generation of **developer evangelists**. Developer evanglists are people
who go and speak about their company's products at conferences and hackathons.
They attend these events and give talks and live demos focused around their company and
what they can offer. It is a way to appeal to their users, the developers!

Starting the program all the way back in January, I was really nervous on what it
meant to be a part of this. In my mind it was,

>I have to do what? Build a project, contribute to Open Source,
give a talk to group of people,  and a long list of other things? I don't even really know any language
beyond C and Java (barely). Are they sure they want **me** to be a part of this program?

The amazing and inseparable sisters leading the program, Cassidy and Cami Williams,
reassured me that they did not have any doubts selecting me, or any of the other 26
Clarifai Champions.

When we all finally met for our introductions on Google Hangouts
and made an amazing Slack team, I knew I made the right decision by staying with it.
Every day that I am in our Slack, I get amazing feedback and have wonderful conversations.
I feel as though I grew even within our first month of being together. These were
energetic and passionate people and they felt just as nervous!

This program has already helped me grow a lot more confident in my ability and
strengthened my resolve for pursuing a career in tech, no matter if it is
as a developer or anything else. Things are still scary to me, but I am willing to take
the leap of faith necessary to see the wonderful things that can come from it.

I hope you keep following along and hear more about what Clarifai and the Champs are up to!
