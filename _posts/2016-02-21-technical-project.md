The Clarifai Champion is a program by the awesome NY Startup, Clarifai, in order
to support the next generation of developer evangelists. These people are the ones
who go and speak about their companies' products at conferences or hackathons and
show how to use it for their products and why.

Starting the program all the way back in January, I was really nervous on what it
meant to be a *developer evangelist*. In my mind it was, "I have to *talk* about
the APIs that I work with? I don't even really know any language beyond Java and C.
Are they sure they want me to be a part of this program?"

But once we got us all together for our introduction to the Clarifai Champions
