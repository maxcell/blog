I have fallen a bit behind with my blog posts unfortunately. Though it is still really good. This year has been full of really amazing opportunities that have come to me. Coming away from 2017, I wanted to bring positive things into my life and it was full swing with a new job. Also it was my birthday last Thursday. It was a ton of fun, and I got to celebrate it with the people I wanted to most. Here's some more updates.

This new job is being a teacher! I get to help students grow and learn more about the beauties of programming. I cannot thank people enough for getting me to this point though. Like every day coming into the office has been a dream. The support from my coworkers is OUTSTANDING. The ambitions they have inspire me to continue to grow. They also have completely valued my thoughts from the beginning.

Also with the start of the year, I have come into another relationship. This person loves to hear my excitement about work and is constantly supporting my silliness. We have a lot of common attributes together but we also appreciate our separate identities. And the insecurities that I do have, he is willing to be patient with me which is beyond appreciative.

Also a bit before the start of this month, I have taken in a roommate. He's incredible. He moved from a different state and now we push each other to be better, while still being supportive of who want to be. I have made sure to push him to be a bit more social than he normally is and it is working for the most part. I hope he continues to enjoy the city. We are going to end up moving after a few months.

All in all, this year has been good. I've been asked to speak on a LGBT+ in Technology panel and a few other things that are in the works. I cannot thank everyone enough for helping me get here. Let's see how this year continues to go.
