I have noticed in myself that I have been spending more time reflecting on what I have
done with my life since I have entered university. I have noticed in myself the changes
I have gone through from Freshman year to where I am now. When I first arrived at
university, I would pretty much only attend class and go back to my room and stay
inside my space and not even really talk to my roommates. I didn't really know anyone
and I was alone for the most part as my high school didn't bring many people with it.

Now I am finishing up my third year and have a lot of cool and awesome experiences under
my belt. I have gone to California twice, once for my program with Google and the other
for the OUTC. I have worked on some awesome projects with some awesome people and I can
say that I feel so much more confident on my future than ever before.
