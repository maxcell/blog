Clarifai Champions is a program hosted by the awesome NY Startup, Clarifai, in order
to support the next generation of **developer evangelists**. Developer evanglists are people
who go and speak about their company's products at conferences and hackathons. Not only
do they spread their company's name across the globe with these events. Another role that they play is to get people to use these products whether it is through offering prizes or
giving live demos!

Starting the program all the way back in January, I was really nervous on what it
meant to be a part of this. In my mind it was,

>_I have to do what? Build a project, contribute to Open Source, give a talk to group of people,  and a long list of other things? I don't even really know any language
beyond Java and C. Are they sure they want **me** to be a part of this program?_

The amazing and inseparable sisters leading the program, Cassidy and Cami Williams,
assured me that they did not have any doubt selecting me, along with the other 26
Clarifai Champions. When we all finally met for our introductions on Google Hangouts
and made an amazing Slack team, I knew I made the right decision by staying with it.
Every day that I am in our Slack, I get amazing feedback and have wonderful conversations.
I feel as though I grew even within our first month of being together. These were
energetic and passionate people just like myself and they wanted to get better as well!
