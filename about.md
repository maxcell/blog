Howdy!

I am Prince Wilson and I have worked as a developer evangelist over at a company called [Clarifai](https://www.clarifai.com). I am also a [University of Central Florida](http://www.ucf.edu/) Alumnus who studied Computer Science.

It has only been a few years since I have been at the development game but I have
come a long way. From being the shy kid that had no idea how to program in C,
I have made it to the Big Apple writing out code that many other people rely on!

Back in the day, I used to help out an amazing organization called [Tech Knights](http://techknights.org) who runs the amazing [Knight Hacks](http://knighthacks.org).
My hope was to bring the experience of hackathons to more students before my time is
up at UCF. These events brought me the courage to speak in front of people and take
chances in my future. They encouraged me to work towards my dreams and be proud in
anything that I build.

This blog is meant an account of my life as it progresses further with development.
Hope you enjoy!
