Howdy,

I am Prince Wilson! I am a Computer Science student at the [University of Central Florida](http://www.ucf.edu/).
It has only been a few years since I have been at the development game but I have
come a long way. From being the shy kid that had no idea how to program in C,
I have made it to placing at hackathons.

Back in Spring 2015, I was the founding Treasurer to [Knight Hacks]("https://knighthacks.org"), UCF's first intercollegiate
hackathon. As of February 2016, I am now the President of this wonderful organization.
My hope is to bring the experience of hackathons to more students before my time is up
at UCF. These events brought me the courage to speak in front of people and take
chances in my future. They encouraged me to work towards my dreams and be proud in
anything that I build.

This blog is meant an account of my life as it progresses further with development.
Hope you enjoy!
